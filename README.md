# Hippo7
<center>"Why is this called hippo7? I don't know, but hippos are cool."</center>

Hippo7 is a tool for visual live shows that can be synchronized to music.

The tool was build by [Benedikt Wiberg](https://github.com/qway/) and myself during an TUM Project at [Luminovo.ai](https://luminovo.ai).
